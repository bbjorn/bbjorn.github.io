              I am a junior UX Designer who is currently working as an educator
              who teaches web design and front-end development for various
              vocational universities (yrkeshögskolor in Swedish) in and around
              Gothenburg.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy creating things, both digital and physical, a passion that
              has been helpful in both my professional roles. I am a social and
              creative person who likes to get things done, and my friends have
              often described me as a ”doer”.

          I also have leadership experience from my time of being chairman in
          the Student Educational Committee and as a member of the Student
          Division Board, and I enjoy working with other people a lot. I have
          done some design work for companies twice through different courses at
          Chalmers and once as a part time job where I was coaching a fifth
          grade class during a design competition.

        <p>
          I was born in Gothenburg and have lived all my life in or around the
          city. From a young age I was interested in science and technology.
          During high school I specialized in technology and mathematics, with
          the goal of studying at Chalmers University of Technology. I started
          out studying Chemistry with Physics, but after a while I realized that
          that wasn’t really my thing and switched to a bachelor in Software
          Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          While studying for my bachelor's degree I was very active in the
          student union. Doing everything from organizing parties, maintaining
          student premises, and writing two plays, as well as taking on
          leadership positions within the Student Educational Committee and
          Student Division Board. Outside of school I also organized monthly
          LARP events for kids ages 12-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a close relative of mine went through a severe stroke and had to
          spend a lot of time in hospitals, I re-evaluated my life. I think I
          became a more empathic person and people became more important to me.
          As such I started to take my studies more seriously and started taking
          more human centric courses. When it became time to select a master’s
          programme I decided to study Interaction Design and had a blast
          studying those courses. During my masters I joined a mentorship
          programme and got to experience how a real designer worked, and I also
          was a member of the programme's reception committee.

        <h2 class="txt-underline">Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          I became interested in UX design when a close relative of mine was
          going through rehabilitation after a stroke. During this period she
          was using a lot of digital tools to retrain her brain with things like
          reading, memory and speaking. These programs generally had solid
          back-end functionality, but they were lacking in several UI aspects.
          For example they often hadn’t adapted the size of the interface in
          order to make sure that someone with restricted finger movement could
          use them. Another common problem was that they often overwhelmed the
          user with information that was not relevant to the task at hand. Lots
          of menus and options were visible while therapy part of the program,
          which would distract the user. Not a big problem for a neurotypical
          user, but it would make the task significantly harder for a stroke
          patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all this experience has shown me the importance of good design.
          Before this period I was more interested in algorithms and back-end
          programming, and had at that time thought that design was something
          that only hipsters cared about. But then I saw first hand how bad
          design could really lower the overall impact of an otherwise good
          application. During this time I also rediscovered myself and I
          realized that I wanted to work more closely with people and as such I
          decided to study to become an interaction designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my studies and through being part of a mentorship programme I
          learned that the end-user is not the only person you are designing
          for. Take the customer as an example, it may or may not be the same
          person as the end user, and the customer of the product may not be the
          same as the customer for the design. As a designer you need to know
          who you are designing for and when I say that my motivation as a
          designer is that I want to help people, I don’t mean just the
          end-user, but everyone who is affected by my design.
