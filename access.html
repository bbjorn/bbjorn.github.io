              As this project was not just about designing a product, but to
              design an entire brand we were introduced to tools to help with
              that. For example we conducted competitor brand analysis together
              with moodboards to understand what was important aspect to our
              brands and its competitors.

          <div class="right textblock">
            <p>
              At the end of the project we had created a new Brand Platform for
              Access, and had written a set of guidelines for how to design for
              this new brand, that we then had to follow as we our primary focus
              shifted to create a product for the new brand.

              In order to understand what it was that made the current version
              of products appear less inclusive than desired we interviewed
              people who had come in contact with existing products of the brand
              and constructed simple personas that highlighted issues with
              inclusivity.

          <div class="right textblock">
            <p>
              These personas were then used to construct Customer Journeys,
              where we simulated a normal interaction with the existing products
              and tried to estimate the emotional experience at each instance of
              the interaction.

        <p>
          Access was one of the last projects I worked on before I started with
          my master’s thesis and as it was a project I did for a real company it
          made the project feel very real.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final product we presented was an app that had been sketched out
          in Illustrator. As a group we did put more of our focus into the brand
          redesign than the product design, and I honestly think the product
          suffered from that. Had I been able to redo the project I would have
          used Figma or XD to create a higher fidelity prototype with some
          actual functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am happy with the rebranding. I picked up some valuable lessons on
          how to work with a brand, and an understanding on how brands work.
