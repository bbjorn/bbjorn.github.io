		<h2>Robo Pop</h2>
		
		<div class="intro-grid-container">
			<div class="intro-left">
				<p> Date - August to September 2018 </p>
				<p> Problem - Design installation aimed at making girls (age 12-16) interested in sensory technology and Internet of things. </p>
				<p> Design - A robotic band controlled either a website or smart household items.</p>

		<h2>Robo Pop - User Research</h2>

			<div><img src="img/robopop/rp-universeum.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt="A photo of the science centre were we did the project"></div>
			<div><p>To get a better perspective on our main target group, teenage girls, we did go to school and did short interviews in the form of a questionnaire. It included questions about knowledge of Internet of Things, as well as habits around household items. </p></div>  
			<div><p>A secondary, but very important, user group that we had to consider were young children as our design needed to be durable enough to survive interaction with them. As such we followed a school class to the science centre and did observational studies such as the shadowing protocol. </p></div>

		<h2>Robo Pop - Prototyping</h2>
		<div class="grid-container">
			<div><img src="img/robopop/rp-exhibit.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt="A photo of the Robo Pop exhibition"></div>
			<div><img src="img/robopop/rp-programming.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt="A photo of someone programming a drum for Robo Pop"></div>
			<div><p>During this project we constructed real working physical prototypes that included all the functionality that an IoT band needed. Robotic arms, sensors and the ability to send message to a server were things I worked on.</p></div>
			<div><p>This meant that we did a lot more coding during this project than I usually do, and as it was a very machine oriented project it meant that I had to learn Arduino during this course.  </p></div>
		</div>

		<h2>Robo Pop - Results</h2>
		<img src="img/robopop/rp-finished.png" class="img-designresults" alt="A photo of the Robo Pop exhibition">
		<p>The prototype we created turned out great. It got lots of attention during the exhibition and was one of the more popular installations. And more information about it can be found at this website: <a href="http://idxpo.se/2018/robopop/">http://idxpo.se/2018/robopop/</a></p>
		<p>However, as successful as it was with the visitors of the science centre, we did not succeed to the extent that we wanted to in attracting our main target group. There were very few preteend and teenage girls at the science center during the exhibition and we succeeded a bit too well in attracting our secondary user group in young children. </p>
		<p>All in all I am happy with the project, but it could benefit from another iteration to expand upon the ideas. </p>

		<h2 >Train Buddy</h2>
		
		<div class="intro-grid-container">
			<div class="intro-left">
				<p> Date - September to October 2017</p>
				<p> Problem - To come up with a design for a user group in a certain situation, in our case “immigrants” and “the train”.</p>
				<p> Design - Design - An app that help immigrants by introducing them to helpful natives on the train.</p>

			<div><img src="img/trainbuddy/tb-designprocess.JPG" class="img-designmiddle" alt=""></div>
			<div><p>The project started with a large brainstorming session, which was then augmented a sketch storming technique that incorporated concepts from the 635 brainwriting technique. </p></div>  
			<div><p>An important part of this project was that we were for the first time creating our own design process</p></div>

			<div><img src="img/trainbuddy/tb-trainstation.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt=""></div>
			<div><p>I together with another student wrote a questionnaire to investigate how train habits differ between immigrants and natives. </p></div>  
			<div><p>This survey was conducted both on the internet and also done on location at a train station. This taught me how to approach people.</p></div>

		<img src="img/trainbuddy/trainbuddy-logo.png" class="img-designresults" alt="The logotype of the Trainbuddy app." style="width:50%">
		<p>The Train Buddy project was important to me as it was the first time I got to feel like I was responsible for the project. In earlier projects we had been told what methods to use and when to use them, and this time it was all up to us. </p>
		<p>There are some things that could have been improved though. We had very tight time constraints, and as such we didn’t have time to implement the findings of the user studies into the prototype properly. </p>
		<p >Overall this project taught me a lot.This was the first time I interviewed real people and tried to come up with ideas to solve real problems, rather than working with other students pretending to be users. And I learn a lot of valuable lessons regarding how to structure a design project.</p>

			<div><img src="img/access/brandplatform.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt="An image displaying the brand platform tool" style="height: 100%; width: 100%"></div>
			<div><p>As this project was not just about designing a product, but to design an entire brand we were introduced to tools to help with that. For example we conducted competitor brand analysis together with moodboards to understand what was important aspect to our brands and its competitors.</p></div>  
			<div><p>At the end of the project we had created a new Brand Platform for Access, and had written a set of guidelines for how to design for this new brand, that we then had to follow as we our primary focus shifted to create a product for the new brand.</p></div>

			<div><img src="img/access/ac-customerjourney-trans.png" class="img-designmiddle" alt="" style="height: 100%; width: 100%"></div>
			<div><p>In order to understand what it was that made the current version of products appear less inclusive than desired we interviewed people who had come in contact with existing products of the brand and constructed simple personas that highlighted issues with inclusivity. </p></div>  
			<div><p>These personas were then used to construct Customer Journeys, where we simulated a normal interaction with the existing products and tried to estimate the emotional experience at each instance of the interaction.</p></div>

				<p>Access was one of the last projects I worked on before I started with my master’s thesis and as it was a project I did for a real company it made the project feel very real. </p>
				<p>The final product we presented was an app that had been sketched out in Illustrator. As a group we did put more of our focus into the brand redesign than the product design, and I honestly think the product suffered from that. Had I been able to redo the project I would have used Figma or XD to create a higher fidelity prototype with some actual functionality. </p>
				<p>I am happy with the rebranding. I picked up some valuable lessons on how to work with a brand, and an understanding on how brands work. </p>
