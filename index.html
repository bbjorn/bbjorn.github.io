		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="VikingSquare.jpg" alt="A portrait of me" style="border-radius:50%; width:35%;  float: left; margin-right:15px;">	
		<p>I have just finished writing my master's thesis regarding trust in robotic vacuum cleaners at the department of Design and Human Factors at Chalmers University of Technology. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a master's degree in Interaction Design. I enjoy creating things, both digital och physical. </p>
		<p>I am a social and creative person who likes to get things done, and my friends have often described me as a ”doer”. I also have leadership experience from my time of being chairman in the Student Educational Committee and as a member ofthe Student Division Board, and I enjoy working with other people a lot. I have done some design work for companies twice through different courses at Chalmers and once as a part time job where I was coaching a fifth grade class during a design competition. </p>
