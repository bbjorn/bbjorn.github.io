              I am a junior UX Designer who is currently working as an educator
              who teaches web design and front-end development for various
              vocational universities (yrkeshögskolor in Swedish) in and around
              Gothenburg. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing

              I enjoy creating things, both digital och physical, a passion that
              has been helpful in both my professional roles. I am a social and
              creative person who likes to get things done, and my friends have
              often described me as a ”doer”.

          />
          <p>
            Both as a designer and as an educator my interest have lied in the
            interaction between humans and computers. As a UX designer I learned
            how to improve people’s experience with applications, while as an
            educator I am teaching students about technology. As I gained more
            experience in both fields it became clear to me that the soft skills
            that make great designers are the same as those that make great
            teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example being able to articulate critique of a product in such a
            way that you can explain both the good and the bad parts of it is a
            skill that all designers should have. In the same way a great
            teacher will tell a student both what they did well and what they
            need to improve in an assignment they have done. Whereas an average
            designer or teacher might zero in on either the good or the bad
            parts of the feedback, or worse not give any at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my experience, another skill that great designers and educators
            have in common is being able to communicate in a manner that makes
            people listen to them. You might be pitching the idea of the century
            or teaching the most interesting subject ever, but if you can’t grab
            people's attention they are going to forget what you were talking
            about a few minutes after they have left the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last skill I want to highlight is to be a good listener. Being
            able to listen to and understand someone is crucial while doing user
            research, during a discussion with the team or in a classroom, or
            when a student or tester is explaining why they got stuck on a task.
            It can help you notice ideas that might otherwise have been drowned
            in noise, or give someone the confidence to tell you a problem that
            they are feeling embarrassed about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that both educators and designers have a lot of things
            they can learn from each other, and being good at one of them will
            give you a leg up on the other.

            The image below is the result of a project I did in an advanced
            computer graphics course. It's a procedural generation, based upon a
            ray marching algorithm.
            <a
              href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsKfzz"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >The code can be found here</a
            >, where it has been uploaded to a website called Shadertoy, which
            not only hosts but also renders it live. Even though it is a few
            years old now I still consider it the coolest thing I have ever
            programmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then my coding has mostly been done in service of something
            else. I have created simple robots in Arduino to show that a concept
            can be turned into a real physical project. I have created various
            websites mostly because I wanted to test different languages and
            frameworks for front-end development. And lately I have mostly been
            creating programs that are the solutions to various assignments I
            have been giving out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I try to teach programming in a classroom environment in an
            iterative manner that is close to the way that I am approaching a
            programming problem. For example an assignment might start with
            asking a student to read a name from the console. The next step
            could be to ask the students to add a “Hello” infront of the name
            before printing it. Next step could be to change the capitalization
            to the name so that it always has proper capitalization. Keep adding
            small challenges that increase in difficulty until the program has
            turned from something that reads names to cypher that encodes and
            decodes secret messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The small steps makes the final problem seem less daunting for
            beginner students, while more advanced students get to the harder
            problem quicker. The same way I would try to deconstruct a problem
            before starting coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I want to mention how beneficial it is to both have
            knowledge about UX and coding, regardless of which role I have. To
            begin with it makes communication easier, as knowledge of the terms
            and tools used by both professions. As a designer it makes me more
            aware of difficulties involved in implementing different designs,
            which would mean that less time and money is wasted on exploring a
            concept that ultimately will have to be scrapped. And as a developer
            I have a greater understanding on how different implementations
            might be seen by the end-user.
