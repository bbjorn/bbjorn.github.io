                    Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.

                    I created this website based upon my old portfolio in order to teach myself how to code in react. The CSS and general design is the mostly same in both version, but old one use pure html. Right now the code portfolio is a bit barebones, but the plan is to add more features using external backends to this page. It has a github repository which can be found here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to learn how to code React with a backend I decided to implement a small app that uses an API from OpenWeather. The icons used are also from OpenWeather. The main focus was on coding during this particular project and I might revisit it and work a bit more on its presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I have developed my own 3D engine that procedually generates mountains. Go look at it on shadertoy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And while you’re at it look at my GitHub as well.
