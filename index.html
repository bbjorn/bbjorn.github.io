              I am a junior UX Designer who is currently working as an educator
              who teaches web design and front-end development for various
              vocational universities (yrkeshögskolor in Swedish) in and around

              I enjoy creating things, both digital och physical, a passion that
              has been helpful in both my professional roles. I am a social and
              creative person who likes to get things done, and my friends have
              often described me as a ”doer”.

                Other than being a designer I am also a educator of web
                development and design. As a UX designer I learned how to
                improve people’s experience with applications, while as an
                educator I am teaching students about technology. As I gained
                more experience in both fields it became clear to me that the
                soft skills that make great designers are the same as those that
                make great teachers.

                As I was teachuing courses in HTML and CSS, I noticed that
                several of my students had a hard time grasping how CSS works
                and that they as a result found it quite tedious to work with. A
                lot of them weren't seeing the potential of the language, and
                had an attitude that they would rather use JavaScript to fix
                things.

                I made this website that I call my

                way of teaching yourself CSS while at the same time showcasing
                that you can create quite advanced things using only HTML and
                CSS.

            >, where it has been uploaded to a website called Shadertoy, which
            not only hosts but also renders it live. Even though it is a few
            years old now I still consider it the coolest thing I have ever
            programmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then my coding has mostly been done in service of something
            else. I have created simple robots in Arduino to show that a concept
            can be turned into a real physical project. I have created various
            websites mostly because I wanted to test different languages and
            frameworks for front-end development. And lately I have mostly been
            creating programs that are the solutions to various assignments I
            have been giving out.
          </p>

          <p>
            I try to teach programming in a classroom environment in an
            iterative manner that is close to the way that I am approaching a
            programming problem. For example an assignment might start with
            asking a student to read a name from the console. The next step
            could be to ask the students to add a “Hello” infront of the name
            before printing it. Next step could be to change the capitalization
            to the name so that it always has proper capitalization. Keep adding
            small challenges that increase in difficulty until the program has
            turned from something that reads names to cypher that encodes and
            decodes secret messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The small steps makes the final problem seem less daunting for
            beginner students, while more advanced students get to the harder
            problem quicker. The same way I would try to deconstruct a problem
            before starting coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I want to mention how beneficial it is to both have
            knowledge about UX and coding, regardless of which role I have. To
            begin with it makes communication easier, as knowledge of the terms
            and tools used by both professions. As a designer it makes me more
            aware of difficulties involved in implementing different designs,
            which would mean that less time and money is wasted on exploring a
            concept that ultimately will have to be scrapped. And as a developer
            I have a greater understanding on how different implementations
            might be seen by the end-user.
