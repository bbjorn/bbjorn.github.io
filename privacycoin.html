              This project used different brainstorming techniques at many
              points of process. Not only did we use it to come up with the
              initial idea, but we went back kept using them to flesh out
              different details.

              functionality we wanted, apart from perhaps needing a better paint
              job. This could then be used for our evaluation sessions.

              Physical prototyping was a very important aspect of this project
              and we used different levels of fidelity at different points of
              the project. Starting really lo-fi, with paper and junk we found
              in the studio.

              Once the prototype was complete we had an test session where the
              part of the experience that we couldn’t create with the prototype
              was simulated with the Wizard of Oz protocol.

              These personas were then used to construct Customer Journeys,
              where we simulated a normal interaction with the existing products
              and tried to estimate the emotional experience at each instance of
              the interaction.

          This was an interesting project as it were tasked with creating a
          tangible interface for something that is generally considered a
          digital problem. Also we have really good cohesion within the team,
          and I think that a lot of it stemmed from the creative environment
          that we had created during the project, which is something I try to
          bring with me into future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea we came up with was also very different from what the other
          groups did during the project, most of them doing authentication
          devices and tangible password managers. Though it may be a bit too
          artsy for a corporate setting.
