              <strong>Problem</strong> - To come up with a design for a user
              group in a certain situation, in our case “immigrants” and “the
              train”.

            <p>
              <strong>Design</strong> - An app that help immigrants by
              introducing them to helpful natives on the train.

              The project started with a large brainstorming session, which was
              then augmented a sketch storming technique that incorporated
              concepts from the 635 brainwriting technique.

              I together with another student wrote a questionnaire to
              investigate how train habits differ between immigrants and
              natives.

              This survey was conducted both on the internet and also done on
              location at a train station. This taught me how to approach people

          The Train Buddy project was important to me as it was the first time I
          got to feel like I was responsible for the project. In earlier
          projects we had been told what methods to use and when to use them,
          and this time it was all up to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some things that could have been improved though. We had
          very tight time constraints, and as such we didn’t have time to
          implement the findings of the user studies into the prototype
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall this project taught me a lot.This was the first time I
          interviewed real people and tried to come up with ideas to solve real
          problems, rather than working with other students pretending to be
          users. And I learn a lot of valuable lessons regarding how to
          structure a design project.
